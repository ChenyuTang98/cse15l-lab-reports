## Example 1:
### command:
```
grep -c "Amsterdam" Amsterdam-WhatToDo.txt
```
### output:
```
23
```
Here I used `grep -c "Amsterdam" Amsterdam-WhatToDo.txt` to find the number of lines that matches "Amsterdam" in the given file "Amsterdam-WhatToDo.txt". This is good for me to know how often the certain words have been used and also helps me to catch the main point if I'm reading some articles.

Here I used `grep -c "China" Beijing-History.txt` to find the number of lines that matches "China" in the given file "Beijing-History.txt". This is good for me to know how often the certain words have been used and also helps me to catch the main point if I'm reading some articles. 

# Display the file names that matches the pattern 
Here I used `grep -l` to display the files that contains the given string/pattern.

Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
China-History.txt
China-WhatToDo.txt
China-WhereToGo.txt
Cuba-WhereToGo.txt
```
Here I used `grep -l "Beijing" *` to sdisplay the files that contains the given string "Beijing". Here it means as long as the files contents contain the string "Beijing", then the file names would be displayed here. It is good for me to find the related articles containing the same keyword if I'm tring to do some researches.
## Example 2:
### command:
```
grep -l "Athen" *

# List directories under specified path

```
Here I used `find ./travel_guides -type d` to search for the directory under travel_guides folder. And I got 2 directories under it. The purpose for this is to look every directory under certain folders so that I could know which directory I'm going into if I only remember certain keywords.
## Example 2:
### command:
```
grep -o "China" Beijing-History.txt
```
### output:
```
China
China

Here I used  find the directory under non-fiction directory. The purpose for this is to look every directory under certain folders so that I could know which directory I'm going into if I only remember certain keywords.

# Search files with case insensitive
Here I used `grep -i` to do the case-insensitive search. The key for this is the use of the -i option, which is only one character different from the -name option. The -i option is what makes the search case-insensitive.

## Example 1:
### command:
```
grep -i "hotels" HandRHongKong.txt
```

```
Here I used `grep -i "hotels" HandRHongKong.txt` command to find all the matching string case-insensitive contains "hotels" no matter if they're upper or lower cases under berlitz1 folder in the given file "HandRHongKong.txt". So I got bunch of "Hotels" and "hotels" that are case-insensitive searches.
## Example 2:
### command:
```
grep -i "football" Amsterdam-WhatToDo.txt
```
### output:
```
Football (Soccer)
The Netherlands are football (soccer) crazy and Ajax is the Amsterdam team, one of the most successful in Europe over the last 30 years. They play at the Amsterdam Arena, a fine modern stadium, which is also used for other sporting events â€” but unfortunately it is almost impossible to obtain tickets for matches.
```
Here I used `grep -i "football" Amsterdam-WhatToDo.txt` command to find all the matching string case-insensitive contains "football" no matter if they're upper or lower cases under berlitz2 folder in the given file "Amsterdam-WhatToDo.txt". So I got bunch of "Football" and "football" that are case-insensitive searches.
